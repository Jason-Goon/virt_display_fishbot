# fishing bot


a simple automated fishing botfarm **some** game using computer vision and virtual displays.

## usage

1. install system dependencies for gentoo (no idea why you would have other OS or package manager sounds a bit like a you-issue)

   ```bash
   sudo emerge dwm xephyr xdotool alacritty 
    ```

2. install python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    prepare the virtual display:

python windows99.py


python main.py
